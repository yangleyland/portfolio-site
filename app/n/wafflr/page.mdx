## What is Wafflr?

Wafflr is a video-based social app that helps busy people not just maintain but deepen their long-distance friendships by facilitating a weekly cadence of communication. Unlike Instagram or TikTok, Wafflr is a friendship service rooted in consistent, authentic interaction without the pressure of public feeds or vanity metrics. Unlike BeReal or Lapse, Wafflr is meant to provide users with genuine, substantial insight into their friendâ€™s lives while maintaining its simplicity and convenience.
