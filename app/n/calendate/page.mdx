## Our Story

Calendate began with a simple observation: our busy schedules often prevent us from meeting new people, even when we're open to connection.
We skip the endless swiping and automated matching. Instead, real people work behind the scenes to thoughtfully pair you based on your weekly question responses and calendar availability.
No algorithms, no photo-based judgmentsâ€”just genuine opportunities for connection that fit seamlessly into your life.
