## Our Story

The Tabloid emerged from a vision to create a center for arts, fashion, literature, and music â€“ free from the clutter and distractions of typical news sites. I worked with a talented UI/UX designer to build a custom content management system for our non-technical clients in addition to creating a sleek front-facing experience. From this project, I hoped to combine thoughtful design and engineering to create the best space for viewing content.
